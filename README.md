# EspControl

**Turn an affordable touchscreen into a simple smart home control panel.**

EspControl lets you put the Home Assistant controls you use every day onto a dedicated screen: lights by the door, heating in the hallway, garage controls in the utility room, room temperatures on a desk, or a tidy bedside panel for scenes and alarms.

You do not need to write code, edit YAML, or build your own ESPHome setup. Install the firmware from a web browser, connect the screen to WiFi, add it to Home Assistant, then choose what appears on the display from the screen's built-in setup page.

**Upstream documentation and install guide:** [jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol](https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/)

## Using This Fork

There are no pre-built binaries for this fork — you build from this repo. Everything else about installation and use is identical to the upstream project — the same supported hardware, the same ESPHome/Home Assistant setup flow.

**Option 1 — ESPHome Dashboard (recommended)**

Add a new ESPHome device using one of the device YAML files in the [`devices/`](devices/) directory of this repo. Point the `external_components` source at `github://wonderslug/espcontrol` to pull in the components from this fork.

**Option 2 — Local build**

Clone this repo and compile with ESPHome directly. The `builds/` directory has ready-to-use build definitions that reference local component paths.

## Added Features

Features in this fork that are not in upstream [jtenniswood/espcontrol](https://github.com/jtenniswood/espcontrol):

### HA-driven notification popups

Home Assistant can push a message to the screen using two new ESPHome API actions:

- `esphome.<device>_send_notification` — persistent, stays on screen until tapped
- `esphome.<device>_send_expiring_notification` — auto-dismisses after N seconds

Both accept `message`, `title`, and `message_id`. Arriving notifications wake the screensaver. On dismiss the device fires `esphome.notification_acknowledged` or `esphome.notification_expired` for HA automation correlation.

### HA-driven image notifications

Home Assistant can push an image to the screen — for example a doorbell camera
snapshot — using two new ESPHome API actions:

- `esphome.<device>_send_image_notification` — persistent, stays until tapped
- `esphome.<device>_send_expiring_image_notification` — auto-dismisses after `timeout` seconds

Both accept `image_url` (required; a relative HA path such as
`/api/camera_proxy/camera.front_door`, or any `http(s)` image URL), plus optional
`title`, `message`, `image_sizing` (`cover` — the default, crops to fill — or `fit`,
shows the whole image with accent-tinted letterbox bars), and `message_id`. The device
downloads and decodes the image (JPEG/PNG), capping the requested source resolution and
checking free heap before starting the download — on ESP32-P4 panels the download runs
on a background task with hardware JPEG decode; Home Assistant does all the sourcing.
Arriving notifications wake the screensaver. If the image can't be fetched or decoded,
or memory is too tight to safely attempt it, the panel falls back to a text notification
so the alert still gets through. On dismiss the device fires
`esphome.notification_acknowledged` or `esphome.notification_expired`, carrying
`device_name` and `message_id`, for HA correlation.

### Fully-local web UI (no CDN dependencies)

All web UI assets — the device JavaScript bundle, MDI icon font, Inter and Roboto fonts — are embedded in flash at compile time. The setup page loads instantly from the device with no external network requests. This also means the panel's configuration UI remains accessible when your internet is down.

### Additional icons

New icons in the icon picker: **Laptop**, **Microphone Off**, and **Video Off**.

## What It Unlocks

- **A real control panel for your home** - give family and guests simple buttons instead of asking them to use the Home Assistant app.
- **Room-by-room control** - place a small screen where it is useful: kitchen, hallway, office, garage, bedroom, or next to a door.
- **One-tap routines** - run scenes, scripts, and automations such as movie mode, bedtime, away mode, or garden lights.
- **Live home information** - show temperatures, sensors, weather, dates, clocks, and other Home Assistant readings at a glance.
- **Flexible pages of controls** - keep the main screen simple, then open extra pages for rooms, devices, or less common actions.
- **Local smart home control** - the panel talks to Home Assistant on your own network. It is not a cloud dashboard.
- **Easy changes later** - rearrange buttons, change icons, adjust the active colour, back up your setup, and install firmware updates without starting again.

## What You Can Control

EspControl works with devices and helpers that are already in Home Assistant, including:

- Lights, switches, fans, and plugs
- Scenes, scripts, buttons, and automations
- Blinds, shutters, covers, and garage doors
- Media players for playback, volume, progress, and now-playing display
- Climate controls for thermostats and HVAC devices
- Sensors such as temperature, humidity, power, battery, or custom text states
- Weather, clocks, dates, and time zones
- Built-in relays on supported panels

If Home Assistant can see it, EspControl is designed to make it easier to put that control or information on a touchscreen.

## How It Works

1. **Buy a supported ESP32 touchscreen.**
2. **Install EspControl from your browser** using the web installer.
3. **Connect the screen to WiFi** using the setup screen it creates.
4. **Add it to Home Assistant** when Home Assistant discovers it.
5. **Allow Home Assistant actions** so the panel is permitted to control your devices.
6. **Open the panel's web page** and choose the buttons, sensors, pages, active colour, and display settings you want.

After that, the panel runs on its own. You can still change the layout at any time from a phone, tablet, or computer browser.

## Supported Screens

EspControl supports several low-cost ESP32 touchscreens. Larger screens give you more room for controls; smaller screens are useful beside doors, on desks, or in individual rooms.
