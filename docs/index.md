# Espcontrol

**Espcontrol** is free, open-source firmware that turns **Guition ESP32** touchscreens into a control panel for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Supported panels include the **7-inch JC1060P470** (1024x600, landscape, 20 buttons), the **4.3-inch JC4880P443** (480x800, portrait, 15 buttons), and the **4-inch 4848S040** (480x480, square, 9 buttons). Each panel uses a fixed grid layout sized to its screen, plus a status bar with a clock and temperatures, a screensaver, automatic brightness, and **over-the-air updates**. After the first install, everything is configured through the device's **built-in web page** — no coding or file editing required.

**Source code and issues:** [github.com/jtenniswood/espcontrol](https://github.com/jtenniswood/espcontrol).

## Features

- **Up to 20 buttons** — control lights, switches, fans, locks, covers, media players, and more (9, 15, or 20 depending on screen size)
- **Subpages** — group related buttons into nested pages to organise controls without using up home screen slots
- **Double-height buttons** — make any button span two rows for emphasis or readability
- **Drag-and-drop ordering** — rearrange buttons from the web page on your phone or computer
- **Automatic icons** — the panel picks an icon based on the device type, or choose from hundreds manually
- **Custom labels** — name each button however you like, or leave it blank to use the name from Home Assistant
- **Colour themes** — set the on and off colours for your buttons
- **Import and export** — back up your entire configuration as a JSON file and restore it on any panel
- **Indoor and outdoor temperature** shown in the top bar from any Home Assistant sensor
- **Live clock** — always visible, synced automatically
- **Screensaver** — dims and sleeps after a configurable idle time, or use a presence sensor to wake it automatically
- **Day and night brightness** — the screen adjusts automatically based on sunrise and sunset
- **Over-the-air updates** — new firmware versions are installed automatically, or you can check and update manually
- **Easy WiFi setup** — if the panel can't connect, it creates its own hotspot so you can enter your WiFi details
- **On-screen guides** — step-by-step setup for WiFi and initial button configuration right on the display
