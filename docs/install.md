# Install

Flash the Espcontrol firmware to your Guition ESP32 display directly from your browser — no special software or technical knowledge required.

## What you need

- **A supported Guition ESP32 panel:**
  - **JC1060P470** — 7-inch, 1024x600, landscape
  - **JC4880P443** — 4.3-inch, 480x800, portrait
  - **4848S040** — 4-inch, 480x480, square
- **USB-C cable** — must be a data cable, not a charge-only cable
- **A computer** running Chrome or Edge (desktop). Safari and Firefox are not supported for flashing.
- **Home Assistant** running on your network

## Flash the firmware

Connect the display to your computer with the USB-C cable, then click the button for your panel.

::: tip Which cable?
If the install button doesn't detect your device, try a different USB-C cable. Charge-only cables (often thinner and cheaper) won't work — you need one that supports data transfer.
:::

### Step by step

1. **Plug in the display** using the USB-C cable. If your computer asks to install drivers, allow it.
2. **Click "Install Espcontrol"** above. A dialog will ask you to choose a serial port — select the one that appeared when you plugged in the display.
3. **Wait for the flash to complete.** This takes a few minutes. You'll see a progress bar. Don't disconnect the cable until it finishes.
4. **The display restarts** and shows a loading screen.

## Connect to WiFi

After flashing, the display needs to connect to your WiFi network.

1. **The display creates a hotspot** called **espcontrol-xxxxxx** (the exact name appears on screen). Connect to it from your phone or laptop.
2. **A setup page opens automatically** (captive portal). If it doesn't, open a browser and go to `192.168.4.1`.
3. **Choose your WiFi network** from the list and enter your password.
4. **The display reconnects** and shows a loading screen while it joins your network. Once connected, the screen will show your device's address (something like `192.168.1.xxx`).

::: tip If the hotspot doesn't appear
Power-cycle the display by unplugging and re-plugging the USB-C cable. The hotspot only appears when the display can't connect to a saved WiFi network.

## Add to Home Assistant

Once the display is on your WiFi network, Home Assistant should discover it automatically.

1. **Open Home Assistant** in your browser.
2. **Look for a notification** in the bottom left — it should say a new device was discovered. If you don't see one, go to **Settings > Devices & Services** and look for a new **ESPHome** entry.
3. **Click "Configure"** and follow the prompts to add the device.

This connection is how the display gets the current time, temperature data, and the ability to control your devices.

## Configure your panel

With the display connected to WiFi and paired with Home Assistant, you're ready to set it up.

1. **Find the device's address.** It's shown on the display screen. You can also find it in your router's device list or in **Home Assistant > Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome** (click the device, then look for the IP address).
2. **Open that address in a browser** — for example, `http://192.168.1.42`. This opens the device's built-in web page.
3. **Add your buttons.** On the **Screen** tab, tap an empty slot and choose which Home Assistant device it should control. Pick an icon and optionally set a custom label.
4. **Adjust your settings.** On the **Settings** tab, set your button colours, temperatures, screensaver timeout, brightness, and more.
5. **Tap "Apply Configuration"** when you're done. The display restarts with your new settings.

That's it — your panel is ready to use. See the [Web UI](/web-ui) guide for a full walkthrough of every setting.

## Troubleshooting

### The install button doesn't detect my device

- Make sure you're using **Chrome or Edge** on a desktop computer. Mobile browsers and Safari/Firefox don't support the required browser feature (WebSerial).
- Try a **different USB-C cable**. Charge-only cables won't work.
- Try a **different USB port** on your computer.
- On Windows, you may need to install drivers — check Device Manager for an unrecognised device.

### The display is stuck on the loading screen

- Give it up to 60 seconds after first boot. It needs time to connect to WiFi and download resources.
- If it stays on the loading screen, power-cycle it and check whether the WiFi hotspot appears. If it does, the display couldn't connect to your network — go through the WiFi setup again.

### Home Assistant doesn't discover the device

- Make sure the display and Home Assistant are on the **same WiFi network** (not a guest network or a different VLAN).
- In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for **ESPHome**. Enter the device's IP address manually.

### The web page looks broken or unstyled

- The device's web page loads some resources from the internet. Make sure the display has a working internet connection (not just local network access).
- Try clearing your browser cache and reloading.

### I want to start over

- To re-flash the firmware, connect via USB-C and use the install button at the top of this page again.
- To clear WiFi settings and start fresh, re-flash the device. It will create the setup hotspot again.

## Advanced: ESPHome package install

If you already use ESPHome and prefer to compile firmware yourself, see the [ESPHome Manual Setup](/esphome-manual-setup) guide. This method is for users who want full control over the build or want to extend the configuration with their own customisations.
