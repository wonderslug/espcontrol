# Weather

A weather card displays the current condition from a Home Assistant weather entity. It shows a weather icon and a label such as **Sunny**, **Cloudy**, or **Rainy**.

Weather cards are read-only — tapping them does nothing.

## Setting Up a Weather Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Weather**.
2. Enter a **Weather Entity** — the Home Assistant weather entity ID you want to display, for example `weather.forecast_home`.

## How It Works on the Panel

- The card watches the weather entity's current state.
- The icon changes automatically when the weather condition changes.
- The label uses the condition name from Home Assistant.
- If Home Assistant reports `unknown`, `unavailable`, or an unexpected condition, the card shows a fallback weather icon and a readable label.
- The card uses the **tertiary** colour from [Appearance](/features/appearance), like Sensor, Date, World Clock, and Weather Forecast cards.
