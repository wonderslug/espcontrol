# Slider

A slider card lets you control the brightness of a Home Assistant light entity or the speed of a Home Assistant fan entity by dragging a vertical fill bar up or down.

## Setting Up a Slider

1. Select a card and change its type to **Slider**.
2. Enter an **Entity ID** — the Home Assistant light or fan entity you want to control (for example, `light.living_room` or `fan.office_fan`).
3. Choose an **Off Icon** and **On Icon**. Existing sliders that only had one icon keep using that same icon for both states unless you change it.
4. Set a **Label** (optional) — shown at the bottom of the card. If left blank, the entity's friendly name from Home Assistant is used.

## How It Works on the Panel

- **Drag** the slider to set the brightness or fan speed from 0 to 100 percent. Releasing the slider sends the new value to Home Assistant.
- For lights, the slider uses Home Assistant's brightness control.
- For fans, the slider uses Home Assistant's percentage speed control.
- A coloured **fill bar** shows the current level in real time as it rises from the bottom of the card.
- When the light or fan changes externally (from Home Assistant or another control), the fill bar updates automatically to reflect the current level.

## On and Off Icons

Slider cards always have separate **Off Icon** and **On Icon** fields. Use the same icon in both fields if you do not want the icon to change while the light or fan is on.
