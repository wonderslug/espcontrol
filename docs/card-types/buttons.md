  How to use trigger cards on your EspControl panel to start Home Assistant automations.

# Trigger

A trigger card is a momentary card with no on/off state. When tapped, it flashes the highlight colour and fires an event to Home Assistant that you can use as an automation trigger.

Trigger cards are useful for things like starting scenes, sending notifications, activating scripts, or anything else you'd start with a single tap.

::: tip Running an existing script directly
If you already have a Home Assistant script and just want a card to run it, use an [Action](/card-types/actions) card with **Run Script**. Trigger cards are best when you want to build a Home Assistant automation around a custom panel event.

## Setting Up a Trigger Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Trigger**.
2. Set a **Label** — this is shown on the card and also sent to Home Assistant as part of the event data.
3. Choose an **Icon** (defaults to a tap gesture icon).

Trigger cards don't need an entity ID — they don't control a device directly.

## How It Works on the Panel

When you tap a trigger card:

- The card instantly flashes the **on colour** (orange by default).
- The colour fades smoothly back to the **off colour** over 400 ms.
- An event is fired to Home Assistant with the card's label.

## Setting Up an Automation in Home Assistant

Trigger cards fire an event called `esphome.push_button_pressed` on the Home Assistant event bus. The event name is kept the same so existing automations do not need to change.

On the home screen, the event includes the card's **label** and **slot number**. Trigger cards inside subpages send the **label**.

To create an automation:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes** and create a new automation.
2. Add a trigger and search for **event**. Select **Manual event received**.

3. Set **Event type** to `esphome.push_button_pressed`.
4. Under **Event data**, enter the label of your trigger card:

```yaml
label: Front Door
```

5. Add whatever actions you want — turn on a light, send a notification, run a script, etc.

::: tip Label-based triggers are resilient
Because the automation triggers on the card's **label** rather than its position, you can freely move the card to a different slot on the grid without breaking any automations.

### Verifying Events Are Firing

Before testing, tap **Apply Configuration** on the setup page and wait for the panel to restart. The setup page preview is only a preview; the event is sent when you press the trigger card on the physical panel.

If you want to confirm that events are being sent, go to **Developer Tools > Events** in Home Assistant, type `esphome.push_button_pressed` in the "Listen to events" field, and click **Start listening**. Press the trigger card on your panel. Home-screen triggers include the label and slot number; subpage triggers include the label.

If nothing appears, check that the panel is connected to Home Assistant and that **Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions** is enabled for the ESPHome device. Without that permission, Home Assistant blocks the event before it reaches the event listener.

### Example Event Data

When a home-screen trigger card labelled "Doorbell" on slot 3 is pressed, Home Assistant receives:

```yaml
event_type: esphome.push_button_pressed
data:
  label: "Doorbell"
  slot: "3"
```

::: info Requires Home Assistant actions
The panel must be allowed to perform Home Assistant actions for trigger events to work. See [Home Assistant Actions](/getting-started/home-assistant-actions) for setup instructions.
