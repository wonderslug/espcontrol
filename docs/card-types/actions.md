  How to use action cards on your EspControl panel to run Home Assistant scenes, scripts, automations, buttons, vacuums, and helpers.

# Action

An Action card is a simple one-tap shortcut. It sends a selected Home Assistant action when you tap it, but it does not show an on/off state.

Use Action cards for shortcuts such as running a scene, starting a script, triggering an automation, pressing a Home Assistant button entity, starting or docking a vacuum, or changing a helper.

## Setting Up an Action Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Action**.
2. Set a **Label** - this is the text shown on the card.
3. Choose an **Action**.
4. Enter the **Entity** for the thing you want the action to use.
5. If you choose **Set Number Helper**, enter the value.
6. Choose an **Icon**.
7. Optionally turn on **Show State** if the Action card should light up based on another Home Assistant entity.

## Run an Existing Home Assistant Script

Use **Run Script** when you already have a Home Assistant script and want a card to run it directly. This avoids creating a separate automation just to connect the panel button to the script.

For example, to run a script called `script.mettre_de_la_musique`:

1. Set the card **Type** to **Action**.
2. Set **Action** to **Run Script**.
3. Set **Entity** to `script.mettre_de_la_musique`.
4. Set **Label** to the text you want on the panel, such as `Music`.
5. Choose an icon.

When you tap the card, EspControl sends `script.turn_on` to Home Assistant with that script as the target entity. The label is only what appears on the panel, so it can be different from the script name.

Action cards do not currently pass script variables or extra data. If a script needs inputs, handle those inside the Home Assistant script, or create a small wrapper script in Home Assistant and point the Action card at that wrapper.

## Supported Actions

| Action | Example entity | Extra field |
|---|---|---|
| **Run Scene** | `scene.movie_mode` | None |
| **Run Script** | `script.goodnight` | None |
| **Trigger Automation** | `automation.goodnight` | None |
| **Press Button** | `button.restart_router` | None |
| **Start Vacuum** | `vacuum.k11_vacuum_784c` | None |
| **Vacuum Return to Base** | `vacuum.k11_vacuum_784c` | None |
| **Press Input Button** | `input_button.doorbell` | None |
| **Toggle Helper** | `input_boolean.guest_mode` | None |
| **Set Number Helper** | `input_number.target_level` | Value |
| **Option Select** | `select.wled_preset` or `input_select.house_mode` | Opens option list |

## Option Select

Choose **Option Select** inside the Action card when you want the panel to show and change a live `select` or `input_select` value.

When you tap the card, EspControl opens the option list reported by Home Assistant. Choosing an option sends `select.select_option` for `select` entities or `input_select.select_option` for `input_select` helpers.

This is useful for WLED presets, room modes, house modes, and similar helpers where you want to pick from the current list rather than hard-code one option into the card.

## Show State

Action cards are normally stateless: they flash when tapped, then return to their normal colour.

Turn on **Show State** when an action should behave like a shortcut but still show whether something is active. For example, an Action card might run a scene called `scene.movie_mode`, while **State Entity** watches `input_boolean.movie_mode`.

When the state entity is active, the Action card stays highlighted. If either the action entity or the state entity is unavailable, the card is disabled until Home Assistant reports it as available again.

## How It Works on the Panel

When you tap an Action card:

- The card briefly flashes the highlight colour.
- The selected Home Assistant action is sent with the configured entity.
- If **Show State** is off, the card does not stay highlighted.
- If **Show State** is on, the card highlight follows the state entity you chose.

## When to Use a Scene or Script

If you want a shortcut that does several things, create a scene or script in Home Assistant first, then point the Action card at that scene or script. This keeps the panel setup simple and makes the behaviour easier to test inside Home Assistant.

Use a script for locks that require a PIN or code. EspControl does not store lock codes on the panel.

Use an [Action](/card-types/actions) card when the panel should directly run something that already exists in Home Assistant. Use a [Trigger](/card-types/buttons) card when you want the panel to fire a custom event that a Home Assistant automation responds to.

Use the dedicated card types for richer controls:

- Use [Cover](/card-types/covers) for blinds, shutters, and covers.
- Use [Lock](/card-types/locks) for locking and unlocking doors.
- Use [Lights](/card-types/lights) for light switching, brightness, and colour temperature.
- Use [Media](/card-types/media) for media player playback, volume, and now-playing controls.
- Use [Climate](/card-types/climate) for thermostat and HVAC controls.

::: info Requires Home Assistant actions
Action cards send Home Assistant actions from the panel. If tapping a card does nothing, check [Home Assistant Actions](/getting-started/home-assistant-actions).
