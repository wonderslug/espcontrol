  How to use cover cards on your Espcontrol panel to control blinds, shutters, and other cover entities from Home Assistant.

# Covers

A cover card lets you control a Home Assistant cover entity — blinds, shutters, roller shades, gates, or garage doors — as either a position slider or a simple toggle.

## Setting Up a Cover

1. Select a card and change its type to **Cover**.
2. Choose the interaction:
   - **Slider** lets you drag to a precise cover position.
   - **Toggle** opens or closes the cover with a tap.
3. Set a **Label** (optional) — shown at the bottom of the card. If left blank, the entity's friendly name from Home Assistant is used.
4. Enter an **Entity ID** — the Home Assistant cover entity you want to control (for example, `cover.office_blind`).
5. Choose a **Closed Icon** (defaults to **Blinds**).
6. Choose an **Open Icon** (defaults to **Blinds Open**).

## How It Works on the Panel

### Slider Interaction

- **Drag** the slider to set the cover position from 0 (closed) to 100 (fully open). Releasing the slider sends the new position to Home Assistant via `cover.set_cover_position`.
- The **fill bar** is always vertical and represents how much the cover is closed — a fully closed cover shows a full bar, and a fully open cover shows an empty bar. This inverted fill matches blinds or shutters blocking a window.
- The fill bar updates in real time as the cover moves, tracking the `current_position` attribute from Home Assistant.

### Toggle Interaction

- **Tap** the card to toggle the cover through Home Assistant.
- The card lights up while the cover is closed or closing.
- When the cover is open or opening, the card uses its normal off colour.
- When the cover state changes, the label temporarily shows the Home Assistant state, such as **Open**, **Closed**, **Opening**, or **Closing**.
- After the state settles, the card changes back to showing the configured label.

## Cover Icons

Cover cards always use two icons. In slider mode, the open icon is shown when the cover position is 0%, and the closed icon is shown for any other position.
