  How to control a Home Assistant climate entity from an Espcontrol thermostat card.

# Climate

A Climate card controls a Home Assistant `climate` entity, such as a thermostat, heat pump, radiator valve, or air conditioner.

On the main screen it shows the target temperature. Tapping the card opens a full-screen thermostat page with a target temperature arc, plus and minus buttons, mode tabs, and a preset menu.

## Setting Up a Climate Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Climate**.
2. Enter a **Climate Entity**, for example `climate.living_room`.
3. Set a **Label** if you want custom text on the dashboard card. If left blank, the card uses the Home Assistant name when it is available.

Climate cards can also be placed inside a [Subpage](/features/subpages).

## How It Works on the Panel

- The dashboard card shows the target temperature.
- The card label changes to the active action, such as **Heating**, **Cooling**, **Drying**, or **Fan**, while Home Assistant reports that action.
- The card uses the normal on colour while the climate action is active, and the normal off colour while off, unavailable, idle, or otherwise enabled.
- The detail page uses `min_temp`, `max_temp`, and `target_temp_step` when Home Assistant provides them. Until those arrive, it uses 5-35 °C with 0.5 °C steps.
- Dragging the arc updates the display immediately, but sends the new temperature only when you release it. The plus and minus buttons wait briefly before sending, so repeated taps do not spam Home Assistant.

## Supported Controls

The detail page only shows controls that the climate entity supports:

| Home Assistant attribute | Control shown |
|---|---|
| `hvac_modes` | Mode tabs along the bottom |
| `fan_modes` | Fan selector |
| `swing_modes` | Swing selector |
| `preset_modes` | Top-right preset menu |

## Heat/Cool Mode

For climate entities using `heat_cool`, the detail page supports separate low and high targets.

When both `target_temp_low` and `target_temp_high` exist, the page shows **Low** and **High** buttons. Pick which target you want to edit, then use the arc or plus/minus buttons. The panel keeps the low target below the high target by at least one temperature step and sends both values with `climate.set_temperature`.
