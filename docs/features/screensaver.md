  How to configure screensaver modes and presence sensor wake on your Espcontrol panel.

# Screensaver

The panel can use a screensaver when it's not being used. When active, it can show a dim clock or turn the backlight off so the panel goes dark. Touch the screen to wake it up.

There are three screen saver modes, configured in the **Settings** tab on the [Setup](/features/setup) page:

## Disabled

The screensaver does not run automatically. This is the default setting.

## Timer

The screensaver turns on after the panel hasn't been touched for a set amount of time. Choose from:

- 1 minute
- **5 minutes** (the default)
- 10, 15, 20, 30, or 45 minutes
- 1 hour

### Clock or Display Off

When the screensaver activates, you can choose what happens:

- **Clock** — shows a large drifting clock at reduced brightness (the default). The clock repositions itself periodically to prevent burn-in.
- **Display Off** — turns the backlight off completely.

## Sensor

Instead of a timer, the screensaver is controlled by a motion or presence sensor (like a mmWave sensor mounted nearby). When someone is in the room, the screen stays on. When nobody is detected, the screen goes to sleep — and wakes up again when someone walks past.

To use this, enter the name of your motion or presence sensor from Home Assistant (for example, `binary_sensor.hallway_presence`).

Below the presence entity, use **Then** to choose whether the panel shows the clock or turns the display off when nobody is detected. This uses the same Clock or Display Off options as Timer mode.

Switching back to Timer keeps the sensor name saved, so you can return to Sensor mode later without typing it in again.

::: tip
Touching the screen always wakes it up, no matter which mode you're using.

## Screen Schedule

The [screen schedule](/features/screen-schedule) is separate from the screensaver. Use it when you want the panel to be fully dark during fixed hours, such as overnight.
