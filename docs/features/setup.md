# Setting up your device's screen

Your Espcontrol panel has a built-in web page where you can set everything up. Open it by typing the panel's address into any browser on your phone or computer.

::: tip Finding the address
The address is shown on the display screen when no buttons are configured yet. You can also find it in your router's connected devices list, or in Home Assistant under **Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome**.

### Adding a button

Tap any empty space in the grid (shown as a dashed outline with a **+** icon). A settings panel appears below the preview where you configure the button:

1. **Choose a type** — **Toggle** (the default) to control a device, **Subpage** to create a folder of extra cards, **[Button](/card-types/buttons)** to trigger Home Assistant automations with a single tap, **[Sensor](/card-types/sensors)** to display a live numeric reading or text state, **[Weather](/card-types/weather)** to show the current weather condition, **[Slider](/card-types/sliders)** to control light brightness, or **[Cover](/card-types/covers)** to control blinds and shutters.
2. **Pick the device** you want to control by entering its Home Assistant entity name (for example, `light.living_room` or `switch.garden_lights`). You can find these under **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant. Subpage buttons don't need a device name.
3. **Choose an icon** — type to search, or select **Auto** to let the panel pick one based on the device type.
4. **Set a label** (optional). If left blank the button uses the device's friendly name from Home Assistant.

**[Subpage](/features/subpages)** — works like a folder that opens a new page of buttons. 

**[Button](/card-types/buttons)** — a momentary button that fires an event to Home Assistant for use as an automation trigger. 

**[Sensor](/card-types/sensors)** — displays a live reading from a Home Assistant sensor entity. Use the mode tabs to choose **Numeric** or **Text**.

**[Weather](/card-types/weather)** — displays the current condition from a Home Assistant weather entity.

**[Slider](/card-types/sliders)** — controls light brightness with a draggable fill bar. 

**[Cover](/card-types/covers)** — controls blinds, shutters, and garage doors with a position slider. 

### When Entity On

Each toggle button has an optional **When Entity On** setting that changes what the button shows while the device is on:

- **Replace Icon** — show a different icon when the device is on (for example, an outline lightbulb when off and a filled one when on).
- **Sensor Data** — show a live reading when the device is on (for example, temperature, power usage, or a percentage). Pick the **Sensor** entity and a **Unit** (`%`, `°C`, `W`, etc.).

When the device is off, the button reverts to its normal icon.

### Moving buttons

Drag and drop any button to reposition it. If you drop it onto an occupied space, the existing button shifts to the next available slot.

### Double-height buttons

Right-click a button and choose **Double Height** to make it span two rows. To revert, right-click and choose **Single Height**. If a button already occupies the space below, it gets moved automatically.

## Apply Configuration

After making changes, tap **Apply Configuration** at the bottom of the page. The panel restarts and loads your new settings — you'll see a message while it reconnects.
