# Setting Up Your Device's Screen

Your Espcontrol panel has a built-in web page where you can set everything up. Open it by typing the panel's address into any browser on your phone or computer.

::: tip Finding the address
The address is shown on the display screen when no cards are configured yet. You can also find it in your router's connected devices list, or in Home Assistant under **Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome**.

### Adding a Card

Tap any empty space in the grid (shown as a dashed outline with a **+** icon). A settings panel appears below the preview where you configure the card:

The **Type** dropdown uses these card names on the device:

| Type | What it does | Needs an entity? |
|---|---|---|
| **[Switch](/card-types/switches)** | Controls a Home Assistant entity and shows its on/off state. This is the default card type. | Yes |
| **[Action](/card-types/actions)** | Runs a one-tap Home Assistant scene, script, button, or helper action. | Yes |
| **[Trigger](/card-types/buttons)** | Fires an event to Home Assistant for use in automations. | No |
| **[Sensor](/card-types/sensors)** | Shows a live numeric reading or text state. | Yes, as **Sensor Entity** |
| **[Slider](/card-types/sliders)** | Controls light brightness or fan speed with a draggable fill bar. | Yes |
| **[Cover](/card-types/covers)** | Controls blinds, shutters, and similar cover entities with a slider or tap action. | Yes |
| **[Garage Door](/card-types/garage-doors)** | Controls a garage door cover entity with an open/close tap action. | Yes |
| **[Date](/card-types/calendar)** | Shows the local date, or the date and time. | No |
| **[World Clock](/card-types/timezones)** | Shows the current time for another city. | No, choose a city/timezone |
| **[Weather](/card-types/weather)** | Shows the current condition from a weather entity. | Yes, as **Weather Entity** |
| **[Weather Forecast](/card-types/weather-forecast)** | Shows tomorrow's high and low temperature from a weather entity. | Yes, as **Weather Entity** |
| **[Internal](/card-types/internal-relays)** | Controls a built-in relay locally on panels that have relay hardware. | Choose a relay |
| **[Subpage](/features/subpages)** | Opens a folder-like page of extra cards. | No |

For cards that use Home Assistant, enter the entity name from Home Assistant, such as `light.living_room`, `switch.garden_lights`, `scene.movie_mode`, or `weather.forecast_home`. You can find entity names under **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.

Most cards also let you choose an icon and set a label. If the label is left blank, the panel uses the friendly name from Home Assistant when it can.

### Active Switch Display

Each [Switch](/card-types/switches) card has separate **Off Icon** and **On Icon** settings. The on icon is used while the entity is active.

You can also turn on **Show sensor data when on**:

- **Numeric** — show a live reading instead of the icon, for example temperature, power usage, or a percentage. Pick the **Sensor Entity**, **Unit**, and **Unit Precision**.
- **Text** — show a live text state instead of the label, for example a machine status or current mode.

When the entity is not active, the card goes back to its off icon and normal label.

### Moving Cards

Drag and drop any card to reposition it. If you drop it onto an occupied space, the existing card shifts to the next available slot.

### Card Sizes

Right-click a card and open **Size** to choose:

- **Single** - normal one-slot card.
- **Tall** - spans two rows.
- **Wide** - spans two columns.
- **Large** - spans a 2 x 2 area.

If a card already occupies the space needed for a larger size, the setup page tries to move it to the next available slot. If there is not enough room, the size change is not applied.

## Apply Configuration

After making changes, tap **Apply Configuration** at the bottom of the page. The panel restarts and loads your new settings — you'll see a message while it reconnects.
