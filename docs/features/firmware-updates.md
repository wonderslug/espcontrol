# Firmware Updates

Your panel can update its firmware over the air — no USB cable or computer needed after the initial install. When a new version is available, the panel downloads and installs it automatically (if enabled) or waits for you to trigger the update manually.

## Update Settings

These are configured from the **Settings** tab in the [Setup](/features/setup) under the **Firmware** section. They also appear as controls in Home Assistant.

- **Version** — the firmware version currently running on your panel (read-only).
- **Auto Update** — turn this on to let the panel install new versions automatically. When off, you'll need to trigger updates manually.
- **Update Frequency** — how often the panel checks for updates: **Hourly**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.
- **Check for Update** — press this button to check for a new version right now, regardless of the automatic schedule.

## What Happens During an Update

1. The panel checks the update server for a newer version.
2. If one is available and **Auto Update** is on, it downloads and installs the update.
3. The panel restarts with the new firmware. Your settings (cards, colours, temperatures, etc.) are preserved.

The update usually takes a minute or two. The display may show a loading screen briefly during the restart.

## When New Cards Appear

Some features, especially new card types, need both the web setup page and the panel firmware. If the setup page shows a new card type but the panel does not display it correctly after you apply the configuration, check for a firmware update and install the latest version.

## Checking Updates from Home Assistant

You can also manage updates from Home Assistant. The **Auto Update** toggle, **Update Frequency** selector, and **Check for Update** button all appear as entities that you can control from the Home Assistant dashboard or use in automations.

The standard Home Assistant **Update** entity may also appear, depending on your Home Assistant version.
