# Subpage

A Subpage card works like a folder. Tapping it on the panel opens a new page with its own set of cards. This is useful for grouping related controls together, such as all the lights in one room, without filling up the home screen.

A subpage has one fewer usable slot than the home screen because it includes a **Back** card. Subpage cards on the home screen show a small arrow badge so you can spot them easily.

## Setting Up a Subpage

1. Select a card on the home screen and change its type to **Subpage**.
2. Set a **Label** and **Icon** if you want them.
3. Click **Edit Subpage** in the card settings, or right-click the card and choose **Edit Subpage**.
4. The preview switches to the subpage. Add and arrange cards here the same way you would on the home screen.
5. Click the **Back** card to return to the home screen.

You can also right-click an empty space on the home screen and choose **Create Subpage**.

Subpages can contain Switch, Lights, Action, Trigger, Sensor, Doors & Windows, Slider, Cover, Garage Door, Lock, Date & Time, World Clock, Weather, Media, Climate, and Internal Switches cards. Subpages cannot contain another Subpage card.

## Open a Page From Home Assistant

You can ask Home Assistant to wake the panel and open a page directly. This is useful in automations, scripts, dashboards, or voice routines where you want the panel to jump to a relevant page.

Use the ESPHome action named after your device:

```yaml
action: esphome.<device_name>_navigate
data:
  target: "Lights"
```

Replace `<device_name>` with the ESPHome device name shown in Home Assistant. For example, if the device is called `hall_panel`, the action is:

```yaml
action: esphome.hall_panel_navigate
data:
  target: "Lights"
```

The `target` value can be:

- `home` or `main` to open the home screen.
- The **Label** you set on a Subpage card, such as `Lights`, `Heating`, or `Media`. Matching is not case-sensitive, so `lights` and `Lights` work the same way.
- `slot:3` to open the subpage attached to home screen slot 3. This is mainly a fallback for troubleshooting; using the subpage label is easier.

You do not need to know a page number. Use the same label you gave the Subpage card on the home screen.

If two subpages use the same label, the first matching home screen slot opens. To avoid surprises, give each subpage a unique label. If Home Assistant sends a label or slot that does not exist, the panel logs a warning and stays on the current page.

The panel wakes before navigating, so the action works when the screen is off, dimmed, or showing the clock screensaver. It does not change long-press behavior. If you use the [Home screen timeout](/features/idle), the panel will still return to the home screen using that normal setting.

## Show State

Turn on **Show State** if you want the Subpage card on the home screen to show state.

Subpage cards can show state in three ways:

- **Icon** uses the card's **Icon** as the off icon and shows an **On Icon** when active. Enter a **State Entity** to track a specific Home Assistant entity, or leave it blank to keep the existing automatic behavior where the Subpage card lights up if any active-capable card inside it is on, open, playing, unlocked, or otherwise active.
- **Numeric** shows a Home Assistant sensor value in the large number style used by Sensor cards. Choose a **Sensor Entity**, **Unit**, and **Unit Precision**.
- **Text** shows a Home Assistant sensor state where the card label normally appears. Choose a **Sensor Entity**.

Read-only cards such as Sensor, Date, World Clock, and Weather do not affect Icon mode. Numeric and Text modes use the sensor entity you enter on the Subpage card. They do not automatically count the cards inside the subpage; use a Home Assistant helper or template sensor for that.

## Moving Cards Between Pages

You can cut, copy, and paste cards between the home screen and subpages. Right-click a card, choose **Cut** or **Copy**, then right-click an empty space on the destination page and choose **Paste**.
