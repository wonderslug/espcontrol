# Screen Schedule

Screen schedule controls what the panel does overnight, then returns it to normal when the schedule says it should be available again.

You will find it in the **Settings** tab on the [Setup](/features/setup) page, under **Screen Schedule**.

## Settings

- **Night Schedule** - turns automatic night schedule behavior on or off.
- **Daytime** - the first hour when the screen should be awake. The default is **6:00 AM**.
- **Night Time** - the first hour when the night schedule starts. The default is **11:00 PM**.
- **At Night Time** - what the panel should do overnight. **Screen Off** is the default, **Screen Dimmed** keeps the panel usable at a set brightness, and **Clock** shows the clock instead.
- **When Woken, Idle Time to Screen Off** - shown only for **Screen Off**. It controls how long the screen stays awake after you tap it during scheduled-off hours. The default is **1 minute**.
- **When Woken, Screen Brightness** - shown only for **Screen Off**. It controls the brightness used for a temporary wake during scheduled-off hours. The default is **10%**.
- **Dimmed Screen Brightness** - shown only for **Screen Dimmed**. It controls the overnight brightness while the panel stays usable. The default is **10%**.
- **Clock Brightness** - shown only for **Clock**. It controls the backlight level used by the overnight clock. The default is **10%**.

When the schedule is disabled, the on and off time controls are hidden and the panel uses the normal [screensaver](/features/screensaver) and [backlight](/features/backlight) rules.

## How the Times Work

The on time is included, and the off time is not included. For example, **6:00 AM** to **11:00 PM** keeps the screen in normal use from 6:00 AM until just before 11:00 PM. At 11:00 PM, the selected night mode starts.

Overnight schedules also work. For example, **8:00 PM** to **7:00 AM** keeps the screen on through the night and turns it off during the day.

If the on and off times are the same, the schedule is treated as always on.

## Manual Wake and Sleep

Touching the screen while it is asleep, or while the schedule clock is showing, wakes it without changing the saved schedule. In **Screen Off** and **Clock** modes, a temporary wake outside the scheduled hours uses the saved wake brightness, stays awake for the saved wake idle time, then returns to the selected night mode.

Pressing and holding a button on the touchscreen for 3 seconds puts the screen to sleep manually. This is stronger than the schedule, so it will not immediately wake again just because the current time is inside the scheduled-on window. Tap the screen to wake it.

## Brightness

Screen schedule works alongside the daytime and nighttime brightness settings. When the screen is awake during scheduled-on hours, brightness still follows sunrise and sunset for your selected timezone. **Screen Dimmed** uses its own overnight brightness setting. **Screen Off** turns the physical backlight off, while **Clock** uses its own clock brightness setting.
